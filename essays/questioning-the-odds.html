The plan is to go up to British Columbia, to visit Vancouver, but I don’t have a passport. I move up to the counter where I sign the documents and show them proof of my Washington state residency. I’m informed that a new photograph is required and that it will be used for biometric identification. It is one of those moments that should not have caught me by surprise., but it did. I had read about what was needed for the enhanced ID, but had somehow overlooked the most important issue.</p>
<p>I tried not to fidget as the photograph was taken, but it was difficult. It nagged at me. The sensation that this image would persist, even after I was gone.</p>
<p>I went to Vancouver the following weekend. On the way back over the border, I was stopped three cars short of the crossing. Cameras, mounted on sticks, stared into the car. At least seven, I counted. Each had a circular lens, the pupil and iris a depthless black.</p>
<p>This week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that The Next Generation Identification (NGI) system, a facial recognition project, has officially completed its pilot program and is now being used in an official capacity. The database of images that the NGI system is expected to use for recognition purposes has been discovered to consist of over 52 million images, including photos of both criminals and innocent individuals.</p>
<p>As I sit back and read this article, I am both haunted and curious as to the origin of the images of the innocent contained within the database.</p>
<p>Those of us who dwell on the Internet are used to having our online activities tracked. In many cases, we accept this behavior not only as the norm but also as beneficial. Social networks such as Facebook use our personal information as a form of web currency, sharing it as requested with third-party websites that then allow us a simple way to login to their service, or even tailor content given our collective “Likes” and “Dislikes.” This form of online behavior is becoming normalized at an increasingly rapid rate, and not without a potentially hidden cost.</p>
<p>When an image is taken, analyzed, categorized, and then used to actively track the location of an individual, is there any doubt that this in someway constitutes a breach of privacy? The argument can be made that this system is used only to track criminals who are infringing upon the law, but there’s an important statistic concerning the NGI system that must be considered. According to documents secured by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) via the Freedom of Information Act, the NGI system has a failure rate of about 20%. This means that one in every five people that are identified, are in fact, misidentified.</p>
<p>I think back to the moment that I was in my car, just before crossing over the border into the United States.</p>
<p>I have a one in five chance of being misidentified as a criminal.</p>
<p>It’s easy to imagine what will happen when I start questioning these odds.</p>
<p>The scrutiny of the eyes is overwhelming. I can feel them. I start to sweat. The steering wheel is slick in my hands. The car in front of me pulls forward and I’m the next man up. I fumble with my enhanced ID as the woman stationed at the crossing tells me to take my sunglasses off. Sorry, I mumble, and hand her the ID. She stares down at it and I wipe a hand across my forehead before the sweat reaches my eyes.</p>
<p>She leans back into the booth and says something into a nearby radio. As she turns back to face me, I already know.</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to need you to come with me.”</p></body></html>

It was a phrase coined by one of his students, who in their struggle with wide-reaching concepts (like geologic time, amongst others), eventually encapsulated their frustrations within the phrase. The Fucking Big is my new favorite thing.</p>

<p>It’s a rework of an old idea, that some things can only be appropriately expressed by saying: “Wow. That is fucking big.”</p>
<p>In the past, before becoming a thorough believer in its newest meaning, I used it in reference to size. I think it’s most appropriate use is with this notion of the imperceptible; the intangibles of life that when we start to think about, we instantly struggle with, and move away from.</p>
<p>H.P. Lovecraft’s At the Mountains of Madness is a critical example of this idea of intangibility. Horror, biology, and geology are the three the main convention being used here, to explore this idea, but these conventions are completely extensible to every other facet of being. Biology, us, humans; geology, Earth, the aggregate results of processes being performed over billions of years. And can you actually reconcile the idea that humans have only been on Earth for two million years? The Homo genus’ reign has accounted for approximately 0.043% of the time our planet has been around.</p>
<p>That’s part of The Fucking Big.</p>
<p>Technology, which is only getting a token mention, is part of this, too. Since the creation of complex information networks capable of spanning the entirety of this long-lived planet, we’ve all been participating in something in which we can only comprehend in a surface-level way. The aggregation and processing of this is not dissimilar to the idea of geologic time. Only, data is being accumulated at such a rapid rate that geologic time has no basis, here.</p>
<p>We are not talking about a look into the past. It would be more accurate to explore an idea of information time, which in many ways, would be the logical opposite of geologic time.</p>
<p>Still, the parallels can be drawn. Maybe I’ll throw together what I perceive to be information time — but to do so would almost certainly require a dynamic document that is changing every moment of every day.</p></body></html>

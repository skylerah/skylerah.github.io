In fact, even historically, the agreed upon aesthetic qualifications were woefully underpowered in their function. An aesthetic, in terms of this article, is the set of principles or rules that a culture has adopted for the objective qualifying of an object’s beauty.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>What is meant by all this is that the qualifications for an aesthetic discount a number of ‘natural’ elements that make up the physical and non-physical world. As humans with five senses, we tend to let those five senses dominate our conceptions. What smells, sounds, tastes, feels, or looks good, is in our minds, good.</p>
<p>With the advent of vast information networks (note: these information networks have a historical precedent, hence why I believe that our so called ‘modern aesthetic’ isn’t even all that modern), as well as the emergence of technologies capable of generative imagery, sound, and touch, only two of the ‘human senses’ are still, specifically, human.</p>
<p>Yet, very little is spoken about this idea, that machines may have to be taken into consideration when speaking about the idea of an aesthetic.</p>
<p>Both natural beauty and machine beauty bare distinct parallels. How is ‘natural beauty’ generated, if not in an identical fashion to machine beauty? They are both processes, each able to be born of random, generative processes, each resulting in a wholly new-but-equally-beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Immanuel Kant, one of the staunch supporters of this modern aesthetic, states that which has no end, cannot be good, and thus cannot be given consideration within the aesthetic. What a narrow convention to have to abide by in a world that is becoming increasingly more and more defined not by what we accomplish individually, but how we are situated within our ever-changing, never-ending, social and information networks.</p>
